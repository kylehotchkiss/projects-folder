# aeropostaux

## Update, June 2019:

This project is archived and the data generation piece will likely never run again - the UPU document it's based off of is no longer online. I had a lot of fun building this in early 2017, but have sent quite a few more Airmails and found that the routing is much more interesting and opaque than my dataset could show! 

------

An overzealous attempt to map out the world's airmail network via an outdated UPU publication.

## Intro

I recently sent a package overseas via USPS. I was sort of sketched out how much they promote the service with zero hints as to how packages actually move around the world. More and more curious about this obscure system, I stumbled upon the agreements countries made via UPU (UN's global postal network branch) to actually facilitate the mail, and learned most of it actually travels passenger airplanes. Interesting!

I stumbled upon this 1,300 page PDF on the UPUs website somehow. I downloaded it right away, curious if I could map the network. I also couldn't find the file again the next time I looked for it, so thankfully I downloaded. Suffice to say this process has been a huge _thorn in my flesh_ and the entire process is a huge mess. Getting data out of this PDF has been possible but the normalization has been difficult to automate.

This project represents my effort and status. Currently, you can make a map with the data but it's a mess and riddled with holes. But it's a start. Maybe if I can get something interesting to show I can email the UPU and they'll feel grace upon this developer and just give me a CSV with the data... and not in French. One can dream right?

## Disclaimer

This data represents the UN's world borders, which differ from US and several other western nations world border definitions.

## Running
