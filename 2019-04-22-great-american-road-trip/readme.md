## Great American Roadtrip Generator

Generates a segmented set of GeoJSON files for roadtrip planning. Requires a specific format in Google Sheets for inputting waypoints and routing locations. (TODO: Document this)

In the future, this code will be modified to recommend good places to stop based on other scripts in my projects repo.
