## USCIS Great Circle Distance

My wife and I are working on our journey to USA. We made a mistake in our first paperwork copy, which was easy to remedy, but meant that our application bundle travelled around the globe twice.

Out of curiousity, I made a Google sheet with the names of every city that our bundle travelled through, having to make a few assumptions about UPS' international parcel routing, and calculated the net distance.

Input file was as follows, in `input/locations.csv`

`%cityname, state, country%,%lat%,%lng%`

While I clearly am not sharing the input file, our visa application paperwork travelled *49,344 miles*. Perhaps we should have created frequent flyer account for it!
